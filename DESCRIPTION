Title: Functions for Optimising subgroup selection in two-stage adaptive 
  enrichment and umbrella designs
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Nicolas Ballarini
Maintainer: Nicolas Ballarini <nicoballarini@gmail.com>
Description: We design two-stage adaptive confirmatory clinical trials that use adaptation to
  find the subgroup of patients who will benefit from a treatment. We make use of 
  a Bayesian decision theoretic framework to optimise the design parameters, using
  a pre-specified utility function that takes the prevalence of the subpopulations
  into account as a measure of overall performance. Our proposal allows altering
  aspects of the trial such as recruitment probabilities of each group in an 
  interim analysis, ensuring efficient use of available resources to maximise the 
  expected gain. This design includes adaptive enrichment and single-stage designs
  as special cases. We use the conditional error rate approach for enabling trial 
  adaptations and consider testing whether there is a treatment effect in each of
  the disjoint subgroups separately.
